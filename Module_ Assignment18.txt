Maintaining the Integrity of your Data.
1) Create a table called Cityorders. This will contain the same onum, amt and snum fields as the Orders table, 
and the same cnum and city fields as the Customers table, so that each customer’s order will be entered into this 
table along with his or her city. Onum will be the primary key of Cityorders. All of the fields in Cityorders will be 
constrained to match the Customers and Orders tables. Assume the parent keys in these tables already have the proper 
constraints.
ANS: CREATE TABLE cityorders
	SELECT onum, amt, snum, cunu, city FROM orders NATURAL JOIN customers;
	
	ALTER TABLE cityorders ADD CONSTRAINT onum_frky FOREIGN KEY(onum) REFERENCES orders(onum);

2) Redefine the Orders table as follows:- add a new column called prev, which will identify, for each order, 
the onum of the previous order for that current customer. Implement this with a foreign key referring to the Orders 
table itself. The foreign key should refer as well to the cnum of the customer, providing a definite enforced link 
between the current order and the one referenced.
ANS: ALTER TABLE orders
  ADD Prevs Int(4) ;
               
  ALTER TABLE orders1
  ADD FOREIGN KEY(Prevs) References Orders1(Prevs);
